[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ember-cli-deploy%2Fplugin-blueprint.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ember-cli-deploy%2Fplugin-blueprint)

This repository holds the blueprint for generating a new Ember CLI Deploy plugin.

It is to be used, currently, with Ember CLI Canary, which you have to install from the [`master` branch](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli).

To learn more about making blueprints, consult [the blprnt repository](https://github.com/ember-cli/blprnt).

To generate a plugin using this blueprint, install Ember CLI Canary (`yarn global add ember-cli/ember-cli`), and run:

```bash
ember new ember-cli-deploy-hello -b @ember-cli-deploy/plugin-blueprint
```
